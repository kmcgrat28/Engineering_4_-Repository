## Dice roller
### Objective of the assignment 
#### We had to make a virtual die that gave out a number between 1-6 at random. The program needed to ask the user to press Enter to roll, or "x" then Enter to quit.  Each time the user presses Enter, the random number would be displayed.  Once the user presses "x" and Enter, the program would end.  
### What I learned
#### This is the project where I really figured out my commiting issue. Everytime I would try to commit my code to my github i would get an error, so I did some googling and found a new command that was " git push origin +HEAD'' instead of " git push origin master", and that worked and I've used it on all of my other assignment because I have been getting the same error.
## Calculator
### Objective of the assignment
#### We had to write a program that gives you the sum, difference, quotient of two numbers. 
#### What I learned
## Quadratic Calculator
### Objective of the assignment
#### We had to Write a simple program that solves quadratic functions.
##### The program sends the three coefficients to a function 
##### The function calculates the discriminant for the quadratic
##### If the discriminant is negative, the user gets a message that there are no real roots
##### If the discriminant is zero or positive, the function returns an array of the two roots.  ##### The program then prints the two roots.  This occurs outside of the function.
### What I learned
#### I, again, had some trouble moving it from my Pi to the correct folders and then committing it, but with some help from Dr. Shields, I learned how to move my files correctly. 
## Strings and loops
### Objective of the assignment
#### We had to write a program that asks the user to type a simple sentence.  The program then takes that sentence and splits it up letter by letter. So, if the user inputs "Hello there friend" the program prints out vertically letter by letter.
### What I learned
#### It's quite a simple code, we just learned he used the split function.
## Hangman
### Objective of the assignment
#### We had to make a virtual hangman game. The program starts by saying something like "Player 1, what's the word?"  One player types the word, hits Enter, and the screen clears.Then the program asks Player 2 to guess a letter.  Player 2 guesses a letter and hits enter.  Say the word was "potato."  If Player 2 guesses "a" the program returns "_ _ _ a _ _."  Then if they guess "o" the program returns "_ o _ a _ o."  You get it.  If Player 2 guesses incorrectly, the program starts to draw hangman.  My hangman looked like this:
#### ---┐ 
  #### O 
#####  | 
 #### /|\ 
  #### | 
####  / \ 
  
### What I learned
#### I used MANY resources for this assignment. I watched quite a few youtube videos, looked up some code, and asked friends for help. I learned that lots of basic coding knowledge I had can be used for even very complex assignments.
## GPIO Pins – Bash
### Objective of the assignment: We had to get 2 leds to blink on and off 10 times
### What I learned: This was a whole new type of assignment which definitely had its challenges. I did the ssh assignment for the most part first to get logged in with my ip address and then the code was pretty straight forward.
## GPIO Pins – SSH
### Objective of the assignment: For this assignment we had to Magically turn an LED on and off remotely. I had already done the ssh part of this assignment because it made past assignments easier.
### What I learned: this one was very similar to the last two, and I was even able to use the same code, you just had to connect your pi to the battery and sign in remotely.
## Hello Flask
### Objective of the assignment: we set up flask to create a framework that allows your Pi to become a web server, meaning it can serve up web pages.
### What I learned: I learned that making a pi to a web server is actually pretty easy, and super cool to see hello world pop up on another computer.
